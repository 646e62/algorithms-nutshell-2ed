Some images found in this chapter are generated. If the figure is 
drawn manually then it is not included in this list. For examples, 
we show where in the code repository to locate the code.

Table A-1: Standard deviation table

  Generated within makefile

Example A-1: Java example to time execution of task

  find in algs.appendixA.example1.Main

  In the first Printed edition, we were able to time 1,000,000 additions. 
  Processors have become so fast that we have had to update this to 8,000,000 
  to 16,000,000 additions.

Example A-2: C code for adding N numbers 

  Simplified version of what is found in Code/Clock/TableA-6

Example A-3: sample configuration file to compare sort executions

  Drawn from Code/Sorting/ValueBased/config.rc
