Information showing how to generate many of the figures in the book can be
found in the respective sub-directories for each chapter:

  chapter1  -- No computed images
  chapter2  -- DONE one hour
  chapter3  -- 
  chapter4  -- DONE 95 minutes
  chapter5  -- DONE 15 hours
  chapter6  -- DONE 13 hours

installed. If you only have Python 2.x then some figures might not generate
properly.
